“Hey. I’m back at the Westwood Estate.”
“Well, it’s raining. That’s an issue.”
“Okay that’s not it. Victoria ran towards me as I was getting to the house. She looked as distraught as she was yesterday, if not more. She led me to the backyard.”
“...”
“Robert is dead.”
“Suicide. Shot himself twice. Stomach and head.”
“He was apparently smoking as well. A cigarette is still in his mouth, although it seems as though the rain snuffed it out.”
“Why should we do that?”
“There’s not much to look at. Just two gunshots and a cigarette.”
“Plus, I think it’s a good idea to meet with Victoria. Maybe she knows more about this.”
“Alright, if you say so. Where should I look?”
“...”
“There’s…”
“An envelope??”
“There’s money in it.”
“...”
“Sorry, I was just surprised to see that I missed something.”
“Anyway, we should get to Victoria now-”
“What.”
“It’s the white end.”
“Not sure why you’d ask that.”
“...”
“Can we go to Victoria now?”
“Will do, I will check in with you in a bit.”
“She admitted to everything.”
“When I went over to her, she was completely calm, as if she wasn’t just crying hysterically.”
“I tried to ask her about what happened, but she just started confessing, still with a stoic face.”
“She confessed that she and Robert were involved in Alexander’s murder. Robert made a poison, and she put it into Alex’s drink. Fell not even a minute later.”
“She didn’t have any remorse while telling everything.”
“They thought about escaping, but doing that would only confirm suspicion.”
“She said it was particularly stressful for Robert.”
“That’s why Robert ended it.”
“I didn’t even need to do anything. She just said everything for me.”
“I’m not sure. I suppose she knew that it was over and gave up.”
“I already had authorities arrest her, so now it’s just me at the estate.”
“...”
“I want to thank-”
“Good one. We just went over it.”
“Anyway, thank you-”
“Stop that.”
“Thank-”
“What are you talking about? I wasn’t even at the estate-”
“...”
“...”
“Victoria gave me a letter as I was leaving.”
“It said to meet in the backyard at 2:00 am.”
“I was paranoid, okay? I thought they were planning on killing me too.”
“...”
“So I came prepared. Hid a gun in my coat.”
“I got to the backyard, and Robert was there. He tried convincing me to stop the investigation.”
“He…”
“He said something about money, but when he reached into his coat pocket, I panicked.”
“I shot him in the stomach.”
“I didn’t know what to do. I tried to save him, but he was long gone.”
“I had to frame it as a suicide, okay?”
“Shot him again, lit a cigarette in his mouth, left.”
“Rain washed it all away. I was clean.”
“...”
“Unfortunately for me, you saw right through me.”
“...”
“But…”
“You can’t do anything…”
“You can’t do anything.”
“You’re just a voice in my ear.”
“As far as anyone else knows, I’m the hero.”
“You know, they thanked me for being the detective in this case, but it wasn’t all me.”
“I would have never been able to do this - avenge Alex - without you.”
“Without your help, I would never have been able to do what I did.”
“So…”
“Thank you for pushing me.”
“No, really. I mean it.”
“I’m grateful for your leadership.”
“I wish you the best in your future, whenever that might be.”
“Thank you for bringing Victoria and Robert to justice.”
“This has been Detective John Davis, over and out.”
