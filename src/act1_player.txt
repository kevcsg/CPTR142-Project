Yes, I can hear you, over.
Who is this?
We can end the formalities, I think I get it.
Hello, I’m talking to you detective.
Why, what's wrong?
Where are you right now?
Lavatory? Oh, you’re British.
Why are you in the bathroom?
No. Why are you in the bathroom?
Doesn’t matter. Why are you in the bathroom?
How are you even communicating to me right now?
What thing works?
Where’d you get this MorseMate from?
How long have you had this?
Why would a detective be asking for help while hiding in the bathroom?
Why are you asking me for help? Isn’t that your job?
What have you gathered at the moment?
Can you give me more context?
Where was Victoria when Alexander died?
Where was Robert when Alexander died?
Of course. First, let’s get you out of the bathroom.
I will help. Where haven’t you looked yet?
