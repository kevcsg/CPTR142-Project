“Hello? Are you there?”
“Yes. I went outside and saw Robert and Victoria talking.”
“When I walked to them, I noticed that Robert was smoking.”
“He told me prefers listening to classical music to calm down, but smoking is his next best option and offered me one. (Didn't even mention his wife Elizabeth as a way to calm down...)”
“No, I don’t smoke. Never had. Hate the smell.”
“If you gave me a cigarette, I wouldn’t even know how to light it.”
“Really? Aren’t they supposed to heal you or something?”
“Well I’m in the lobby right now. We have a lot of rooms to cover, so you can just tell me what to do and I’ll go there.”
“And don’t hesitate to say when you’re done looking, I’m letting you take the reins on this one.”
“Well, I feel pretty good about what we did. If you’re thinking what I’m thinking, I think we know who did it.”
“Well, that's all the time we have today. I’m not too sure about how we’re gonna convict anyone, but what do you think?”
“Well, I’ll check in with you tomorrow morning. I’m planning on having authorities there for locking up.”
“This is Davis, over and out.”
