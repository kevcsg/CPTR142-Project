What happened?
Something wrong?
Okay, anything else?
That’s it?
What?
How did he die?
Let’s go and check out Robert more.
I need more details. Let’s check.
Not after we look at Robert.
Robert first.
Check his coat pocket.
Anything in his pockets?
Why that reaction?
What’s in it?
Not yet.
One more thing.
What end of the cigarette is in Robert’s mouth?
Robert’s cigarette. What color is the end that’s in his mouth?
Go and ask her about all of this.
Yes, go meet with her.
Really?
What?
Right…
Sure…
Why would she just admit everything like that?
Less work for you, I suppose.
No. What happened.
Stop. What really happened?
Tell me the truth, Davis.
Don’t ignore me, Davis.
Where were you last night, Davis?
Davis. What happened to Robert?
Robert’s cigarette. It was lit from the wrong end.
Robert is an avid smoker. His cigarette was somehow lit from the wrong end when he died.
Wait…
No, something will be done.
…
I can’t do anything.
Wait…
No…
