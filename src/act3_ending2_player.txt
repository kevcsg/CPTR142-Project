What happened?
Something wrong?
Okay, anything else?
That’s it?
What?
How did he die?
I’m sorry. Did Victoria say anything?
What did Victoria say about this?
You should ask her about all of this.
Go meet with her.
What?
She’s the murderer?
And it was so stressful for Robert…
So that’s why Robert…
Why would she just admit everything like that?
Less work for you, I suppose.
So that’s it, huh?
Did we do it?
It’s the least I could do.
I’m glad that I was able to help.
You as well, Detective.
Thank you. You take care of yourself too, Davis.
