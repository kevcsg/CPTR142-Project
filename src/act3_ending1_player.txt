What happened?
Something wrong?
Okay, anything else?
That’s it?
What?
How did he die?
I’m sorry. Did Victoria say anything?
What did Victoria say about this?
You should ask her about all of this.
Go meet with her.
What?
She’s the murderer?
And it was so stressful for Robert…
So that’s why Robert…
Well she admitted it. Can anything be done?
We can arrest her, right?
It’s not over!
Is it?
