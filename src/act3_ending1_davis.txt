“Hey. I’m back at the Westwood Estate.”
“Well, it’s raining. That’s an issue.”
“Okay that’s not it. Victoria ran towards me as I was getting to the house. She looked as distraught as she was yesterday, if not more. She led me to the backyard.”
“...”
“Robert is dead.”
“Suicide. Shot himself twice. Stomach and head.”
“He was apparently smoking as well. A cigarette is still in his mouth, although it seems as though the rain snuffed it out.”
“I haven’t been able to talk to her yet. She led me here and ran back to the front of the house.”
“Will do, I will check in with you in a bit.”
“She admitted to everything.”
“When I went over to her, she was completely calm, as if she wasn’t just crying hysterically.”
“I tried to ask her about what happened, but she just started confessing, still with a straight face.”
“She confessed that she and Robert were involved in Alexander’s murder. Robert made a poison, and she put it into Alex’s drink. Fell not even a minute later.”
“They thought about escaping, but doing that would only confirm suspicion.”
“She said it was particularly stressful for Robert.”
“Yes, that’s why Robert ended it.”
“I tried, but no one believed me. The authorities kept asking for proof, but when I told them to ask Victoria, she denied everything.”
“It’s over.”
“There’s nothing we can do.”
“Alex is gone, and no one is willing to figure out what happened.”
“...”
“So, thank you, I suppose.”
“For whatever you did.”
“Or was it what you didn’t do?”
